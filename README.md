# BCNN Bias

This Zenodo repository records my investigation into potential bias in the BCNN presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07424.

I find that the quality of the predictions, as measured by the loss function, depend primarily on the morphology of the galaxies rather than their intrinsic physical properties (as recorded in the NSA catalog). 

This brief check is not intended to be exhaustive; more subtle biases are possible and indeed plausible.

The model investigated here has since been superceded by that used for Galaxy Zoo DECaLS.
